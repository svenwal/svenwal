# SvenWal

These are all my projects starting back to the early 2000s (some of them moved over from Subversion, Sourceforge and even CVS)

I have a passion for open source providing anything from short samples up to full complex solutions like my (very outdated...) Nymphicus multi protocol social media client.

## svenwal?

Just a small fun fact: my username (which I am using eveywhere including <https://svenwal.de>) dates back to the 90th when AOL started to grow and was a very cheap way of getting free internet - for a month. So first month my username was sven, second svenwalther, then svenw followed by svenwa and it all ended with svenwal :)
